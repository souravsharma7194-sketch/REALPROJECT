🏡 Real Estate Marketplace – Next.js + Firebase

🚀 Live Project:
👉 https://ryal-estate-app.netlify.app/

A production-ready real estate web application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.
The project demonstrates real-world frontend architecture, feature control using Firebase Remote Config, and scalable UI patterns.

✨ What This Project Shows (Practical Work)

This project is not a demo UI — it’s a working, deployed application with real feature controls and real-world patterns.

✅ Core Features

🏘️ Property listing UI (sale & rent)

🔐 Authentication-ready UI (Login / Signup flow)

🤖 Chatbot integration (feature controlled)

📢 Advertisement banner (feature controlled)

⚡ Fast, SEO-friendly Next.js pages

📱 Fully responsive (mobile → desktop)

🔥 Firebase Remote Config – Real Usage

Instead of hardcoding features, this app uses Firebase Remote Config to control features remotely without redeploying.

Controlled via Remote Config:
Feature	Control
🤖 Chatbot	Enable / Disable
📢 Ad Banner	Show / Hide
🔐 Login / Signup	Enable / Disable

👉 Why this matters:
Product teams can turn features ON/OFF instantly from Firebase — no code change, no redeploy.
